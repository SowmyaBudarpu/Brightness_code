## These imports indicate that the code using them will involve image processing (cv2 and mediapipe), mathematical calculations (math), screen brightness control (screen_brightness_control), and numerical operations (numpy). Each import brings in specific functionalities that the code may use later on.

1. cv2: This is the OpenCV library, which is a popular computer vision library in Python. It provides tools for image and video processing, including functionalities like object detection, image manipulation, and video analysis.

2. mediapipe as mp: This imports the mediapipe library and aliases it as mp. mediapipe is a library for building perception pipelines. It includes modules for tasks like hand tracking, face detection, and pose estimation.

3. from math import hypot: This imports the hypot function from the built-in math module. hypot calculates the Euclidean norm, which is the length of a vector from the origin to a point in a 2D or 3D space. It's often used in distance calculations.

4. import screen_brightness_control as sbc: This imports the screen_brightness_control library and aliases it as sbc. This library allows you to control the screen brightness of a monitor programmatically.

5. import numpy as np: This imports the NumPy library and aliases it as np. NumPy is a powerful library for numerical operations in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
